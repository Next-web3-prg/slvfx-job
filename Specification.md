# 🛠 Project Specification: Job Board Aggregator Platform

## 🔍 Project Goal

Build a web platform that **fetches, parses, and displays** the latest job listings from multiple third-party job boards in real-time or near-real-time. Optionally, enrich jobs with categorization, filtering, and user engagement (alerts, save jobs, etc.).

---

## 📦 Core Features

### 🧠 1. Job Aggregation Engine

* **Job sources** (scraped or via API):

  * ✅ Indeed
  * ✅ RemoteOK
  * ✅ WeWorkRemotely
  * ✅ AngelList (Wellfound)
  * ✅ LinkedIn (only if access/API available)
* **Fetcher types**:

  * 🔹 **API-based ingestion** (if source provides open or tokenized API)
  * 🔹 **Web scraping** (with rotating proxies & user-agent randomization)
* **Update frequency**: Every 15–60 minutes (configurable)

### 🔄 2. Job Normalization & Storage

* Normalize different data structures from sources to a common schema:

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Senior Backend Engineer",
    "company": "Stripe",
    "location": "Remote",
    "description": "...",
    "tags": ["backend", "Go", "AWS"],
    "source": "RemoteOK",
    "posted_at": "2025-07-05T00:00:00Z",
    "apply_url": "https://remoteok.io/l/12345"
  }
  ```
* Store in a **relational DB** (PostgreSQL or MySQL) or **search-optimized DB** (Elasticsearch)

### 🌍 3. Frontend Web App

* Built with **Next.js + Tailwind CSS** (React + SSR for SEO)
* Features:

  * 🔍 Job search by title, company, keyword
  * 🧭 Filters (remote/in-office, location, tags, job type)
  * 🗂 Categories (Engineering, Design, Product, etc.)
  * ❤️ Save job (user accounts)
  * 🛎 Email alerts (optional)
* Mobile-first responsive design

### 👥 4. User System (Optional, v2)

* Basic auth via email or OAuth (Google, GitHub)
* Users can:

  * Save jobs
  * Set keyword alerts
  * Bookmark sources or companies

### 📧 5. Notification System (Optional, v2)

* Email or Telegram alerts for:

  * New jobs matching saved keywords
  * Trending companies/titles

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend     | Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React, SWR/Axios                 |
| Backend API  | Node.js / Express (or FastAPI if Python)                |
| Database     | PostgreSQL / MySQL                                      |
| Scraping/API | Puppeteer / Playwright / Cheerio / Axios                |
| Scheduling   | CRON (Node-cron, or Celery + Redis)                     |
| Hosting      | Vercel (frontend) + Fly.io / Render / Railway (backend) |
| Caching      | Redis (for recent jobs, duplicate check)                |
| Logging      | Sentry + Cloud logging                                  |

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

* Respect **robots.txt** and source API terms
* Rate-limit requests; use rotating proxies or scraper APIs (e.g., ScraperAPI, BrightData)
* Cache to avoid hitting endpoints too often
* If commercial, obtain **explicit licenses** for job data reuse

| WeWorkRemotely        | Scraping only   | HTML changes often, requires maintenance  |
| Wellfound (AngelList) | Scraping or API | API exists but limited                    |
| Indeed                | Scraping risky  | Limited legal access; high bot protection |
| StackOverflow Jobs    | Deprecated      | Not active as of 2023                     |

Would you like a **starter GitHub repo**, **flow diagram**, or a **database schema** to get started? I can build out a technical foundation for you next.
Here's a **detailed specification** for building a **Job Board Aggregator**—a platform that **fetches and lists new jobs** from other job sites (like Indeed, RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, etc.).
